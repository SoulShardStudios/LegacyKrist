# LegacyKrist
the legacy version of the krist game. HEAVILY DEPRACATED, do not use.     
            
Before the inception of SoulShardStudios this was our main game project. we didn't get very far, but in the end it signaled to the main developer (lubba64) that it was time to      rethink how we were going to accomplish making a game. thanks to this project organization was taken more seriously, we switched to unity, and a general improvement was made.     
                 
this repository is a memorial to that and nothing more. it is completely out of date, in every way.
